## Details:

* Thrower Inserters
* 
Why slowly and delicately roll your items around on belts when they can be thrown at high speeds through the air? Throwers are distinguished by their bright yellow arms. Supports all inserters, even ones added from other mods. Research unlocks the ability to adjust a thrower's range. Thrown items can be caught in Open Chests or Cargo Wagons, other machines and inventories need a Hatch to accept thrown items.

* Player Launchers
* 
Imagine "walking". Stand on a Player Launcher and press the launch key (F by default) to propel yourself into orbit. Make sure you don't land on anything important though. Use Bounce Pads to go even further.

* Bounce Pads
* 
Increase the range of your hops. Can bounce items and players further forward.

* Directed Bounce Pads
* 
Bounce items and players in a specific direction.

* Hatch
* 
~~Blow~~ install an opening onto things so items can fall into them. 

* Open Chests
* 
Chop the top off your iron chests to catch the items you're throwing around.

* Primer Bounce Pads 
* 
Prime grenades, capsules, rockets, and other items to fly much further and activate upon next landing. Switch to spread mode to bombard larger areas 

* Signal Bounce Pads
* 
Act like a Constant Combinator, but are toggled on/off when something bounces on it

* Electric Ziplines
* 
Use your existing power network as a makeshift highway. Consumes about half a steam engine worth of power

* Train Ramps
* 
River in the way of your train? Rail junctions too complicated? Just jump over them! Includes scaled-up bounce pads for bouncing trains further

* Magnet Train Ramps
* 
Use powerful electromagnets to guide trains to an exact desired landing point each time regardless of speed. Uses scaling amounts of power by distance, and has a max range of 100 tiles.

* Payload Wagons
* 
Launch a wagon full of grenades, missiles, nukes, etc. directly to their intended recipients for immediate detonation.

* Impact Wagon & Impact Wagon "Unloader"
* 
Slam this cargo wagon into a reinforced concrete block to instantly unload its entire inventory. Now you just have to load it somewhere else.

See the FAQ for some specific details

##Possible Future Additions
- ~~Mid air train collisions (maybe, that seems like a lot of work)~~ Yeah it's a lot of work
- A bounce pad that lets you redirect different items in different directions

##~~Bugs~~ Special Features
- Mods that allow you to walk on water make it so that items don't splash and disappear.
- Changing a thrower's pickup/drop location using another mod, like Bob's adjustable inserters, may cause strange behavior depending on the change
- Mods that use train IDs, like Logistics Train Network, probably won't work right with train jumps because trains will have a different train ID before and after jumping. Vehicle Wagons 2 being an exception because compatibility was specifically programmed in for it
- Train Ramps don't work when friendly fire is turned off because the ramps rely on the impact damage to detect and start a jump
- Magnet ramps don't have their ranges carried over in blueprints and copy/paste. It'll have to be set up manually after being built.
