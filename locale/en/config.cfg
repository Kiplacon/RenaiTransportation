[entity-description]
BouncePlate=Items or players thrown onto the Bounce Pad will bounce forward another 10 tiles. Works in all 4 directions. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
PrimerBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, rockets, shells, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 40 tiles. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Spread Mode. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
PrimerSpreadBouncePlate=Grenades, capsules, land mines, rockets, shells, and other items will be primed to activate after bouncing on this. The extra power increases the range to 37-40 tiles with a 40 tile spread. Non-primable things only bounce 10 tiles.\nPress "Interact" (default F) to switch to Precise Mode. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
SignalBouncePlate=Acts like a Constant Combinator. The signal turns on/off when items or players bounce on it. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
DirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Bounce Pad but directed. Click to toggle range visibility in alt-view.
DirectorBouncePlate=The Director Bounce Pad can somehow tell the difference between the items that land on it and bounce them in different directions depending on how you program it. Click to set the item filters. Items set in the slots 1-10 will bounce up, 11-20 will bounce right, 21-30 down, and 31-40 left.

OpenContainer=An Iron Chest without its lid so items can fall into it.

PlayerLauncher=Stand on top and press the Interact key (default F) to propell yourself forward 10 tiles. Land on a bounce pad to jump even farther.

HatchRT=Install a Hatch onto things with an inventory to allow thrown items to fall into them.
RTThrower-EjectorHatchRT=A Hatch that, rather than receiving items into the thing it's placed on, ejects the items inside outward 20 tiles away.

RTTrainRamp=A train launching off this ramp has the "current destination" on its schedule bumped forward by one stop. This allows guiding automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp without messing up the intended route. Press Interact to toggle this schedule skipping off when it is not needed.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainRampNoSkip=A train launching off this ramp does NOT affect the "current destination" on its schedule. Press Interact to swap back skipping mode.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainBouncePlate=Trains landing on these up-scaled Bounce Pads will bounce forward again. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTTrainDirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Directed Bounce Pad, but for trains. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTMagnetTrainRamp=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, comsuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp. When chaining ramp jumps in squence, make sure at least one carriage is fully on the ground at all times. Trains skip a schedule stop when jumping off this (Toggled with Interact)
RTMagnetTrainRampNoSkip=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, comsuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp. When chaining ramp jumps in squence, make sure at least one carriage is fully on the ground at all times. Trains do NOT skip a schedule stop when jumping off this (Toggled with Interact)
RTMagnetRail=A powerful electromagnet controlled by the Magnet Train Ramp. It repels or attracts train carriages to help them reach a desired jump range. The particles are a visualization of the magnetic field. Probably.
RTMagnetRampDrain=This buffer powers the electromagnetic pads attached to its Magnet Ramp, emptying all its power into the pads during a jump. Buffer size scales with jump distance, and the buffer fills at 40MW.
RTImpactUnloader=When a train collides with this, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. After impact, the train's "current destination" on its schedule is bumped forward by one stop, allowing for automation using a Train Stop placed after the Impact Unloader and a locomotive on the train facing backwards. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings.

RTTrainRamp-placer=A train launching off this ramp has the "current destination" on its schedule bumped forward by one stop. This allows guiding automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp without messing up the intended route. Press Interact to toggle this schedule skipping off when it is not needed.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTMagnetTrainRamp-placer=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, comsuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp.

RTImpactUnloader-placer=When a train collides with this, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. After impact, the train's "current destination" on its schedule is bumped forward by one stop, allowing for automation using a Train Stop placed after the Impact Unloader and a locomotive on the train facing backwards. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings.

RTPayloadWagon=When this crash lands, primable items inside will prime and fly out in a 10 tile radius. Explosives (as in the item called "explosives", not "things that explode") in the wagon increase the spread radius by 0.2 tiles capping at +30 tiles at 150 explosive. To limit lag, only 1 full stack of each primable item in the wagon will fly out.
RTImpactWagon=When a train with these wagons collides with an Impact Unloader, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings to help with lag.

RTThrower-PrimerThrower=A thrower/turret hybrid! This thrower can fling primable items (grenades, capsules, rockets, etc.) at enemies.
