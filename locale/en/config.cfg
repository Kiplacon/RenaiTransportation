DirectorBouncePlate=The Director Bounce Pad can somehow tell the difference between the items that land on it and bounce them in different directions depending on how you program it. Click to set the item filters.

OpenContainer=An Iron Chest without its lid so items can fall into it.

PlayerLauncher=Stand on top and press the Interact key (default F) to propell yourself forward 10 tiles. Land on a bounce pad to jump even farther.

HatchRT=Install a Hatch onto things with an inventory to allow thrown items to fall into them.
RTThrower-EjectorHatchRT=A Hatch that, rather than receiving items into the thing it's placed on, ejects the items inside outward 20 tiles away.
RTVacuumHatch=A hatch crudely attached to a pump. It sucks up items off the floor in a 5x5 area in front of it and into whatever is behind it.

RTTrainRamp=A train launching off this ramp has the "current destination" on its schedule bumped forward by one stop. This allows guiding automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp without messing up the intended route. Press Interact (default F) to toggle this schedule skipping off when it is not needed.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainRampNoSkip=A train launching off this ramp does NOT affect the "current destination" on its schedule. Press Interact to swap back skipping mode.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTTrainBouncePlate=Trains landing on these up-scaled Bounce Pads will bounce forward again. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTTrainDirectedBouncePlate=Like a regular Directed Bounce Pad, but for trains. Still kinda finicky, mostly just added for the memes.
RTMagnetTrainRamp=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, consuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp. When chaining ramp jumps in squence, make sure at least one carriage is fully on the ground at all times. Trains skip a schedule stop when jumping off this, toggled with Interact (default F)
RTMagnetTrainRampNoSkip=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, consuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp. When chaining ramp jumps in squence, make sure at least one carriage is fully on the ground at all times. Trains do NOT skip a schedule stop when jumping off this (Toggled with Interact)
RTMagnetRail=A powerful electromagnet controlled by the Magnet Train Ramp. It repels or attracts train carriages to help them reach a desired jump range. The particles are a visualization of the magnetic field. Probably.
RTMagnetRampDrain=This buffer powers the electromagnetic pads attached to its Magnet Ramp, emptying all its power into the pads during a jump. Buffer size scales with jump distance, and the buffer fills at 40MW.
RTImpactUnloader=When a train collides with this, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. After impact, the train's "current destination" on its schedule is bumped forward by one stop, allowing for automation using a Train Stop placed after the Impact Unloader and a locomotive on the train facing backwards. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings.
RTSwitchTrainRamp=Acts like a normal Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTSwitchTrainRamp-placer=Acts like a normal Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTSwitchTrainRampNoSkip=Acts like a normal non-skipping Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTMagnetSwitchTrainRamp=Acts like a normal Magnet Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTMagnetSwitchTrainRamp-placer=Acts like a normal Magnet Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTMagnetSwitchTrainRampNoSkip=Acts like a normal non-skipping Magnet Train ramp but also toggles the state of Trapdoor wagons that jump off. A Trapdoor wagon toggled this way will toggle back upon landing.
RTTrapdoorSwitch=A switch that toggles the open/closed state of Trapdoor wagons that roll over this.
RTTrapdoorSwitch-placer=A switch that toggles the open/closed state of Trapdoor wagons that roll over this.

RTTrainRamp-placer=A train launching off this ramp has the "current destination" on its schedule bumped forward by one stop. This allows guiding automatic trains to the ramp you want it to take using a Train Stop placed after the ramp without messing up the intended route. Press Interact (default F) to toggle this schedule skipping off when it is not needed.\nKeep in mind the train might slow down if it approaches a stop, or if the next stop after the jump isn't readily accessible. The train's speed when it hits the ramp dictates how far it will fly. Trains must hit the ramp exactly straight.
RTMagnetTrainRamp-placer=Click on this to set where you would like trains jumping off this ramp to land. Powerful electromagnets will guide train carriages to the desired landing point, consuming roughly 200kJ per tile per jump drawn all at once from the ramp's buffer. The buffer must be full for the magnets to work, otherwise the ramp will act like a regular ramp. When chaining ramp jumps in squence, make sure at least one carriage is fully on the ground at all times. Trains skip a schedule stop when jumping off this (Toggled with Interact)
RTImpactUnloader-placer=When a train collides with this, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. After impact, the train's "current destination" on its schedule is bumped forward by one stop, allowing for automation using a Train Stop placed after the Impact Unloader and a locomotive on the train facing backwards. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings.

RTPayloadWagon=When this crash lands, primable items inside will prime and fly out in a 10 tile radius. Explosives (as in the item called "explosives", not "things that explode") in the wagon increase the spread radius by 0.2 tiles capping at +30 tiles at 150 explosive. To limit lag, only 1 full stack of each primable item in the wagon will fly out.
RTImpactWagon=When a train with these wagons collides with an Impact Unloader, all attached Impact Wagons open their hatches causing their contents to fly out. The faster the collision, the more items fly out and the farther they fly. The maximum number of created projectiles can be adjusted in mod settings to help with lag.
RTTrapdoorWagon=When the trapdoor on this wagon is open, its cargo falls out the bottom.

RTZiplineTerminal=If you have a Programmable Zipline Controller equipped, you can click on this terminal to program the controller with the path to reach any other terminal on the same network, allowing it to pilot the Zipline Trolley there automatically.

RTThrower-PrimerThrower=A thrower/turret hybrid! This thrower can fling primable items (grenades, capsules, rockets, etc.) at enemies. It will lead its shots on moving targets so it can potentially cause friendly fire slightly behind its targeting range.

RTBeltRamp=This high-speed inclined belt continuously lauches its items off the end.
RTfastBeltRamp=This super-speed inclined belt continuously lauches its items off the end.
RTexpressBeltRamp=This crazy-speed inclined belt continuously lauches its items off the end.
RTturboBeltRamp=This hyper-speed inclined belt continuously lauches its items off the end.

RTItemCannon=Loads items into Item shells and accelerates them near-instantly to ridiculous speeds out the barrel using powerful electromagnets and superconductors. Each shot consumes its entire power buffer, which needs to be recharged before firing again. A FULL stack of any item goes in the first slot, and Empty shells go in the second inventory slot. Press Interact to turn the cannon's guide laser on/off.
RTRicochetPanel=Deflects the Item shells launched from Electromagnetic item cannons using focused bursts of energized magnetic fields. Each burst consumes its power buffer. If its power buffer is less than 75% when an Item shell hits, it may not have enough power to safely repel it.
RTCatchingChute=Catches Item shells mid flight and deposits the encased items into the attached chest.
RTMergingChute=Merges the flight paths of Item shells coming in from two different directions, redirecting them out to the same output port. If its power buffer is less than 75% when an Item shell hits, it may not have enough power to safely redirect it.
RTDivergingChute=Item shells flying into then input port alternate exiting between the two output ports. If its power buffer is less than 75% when an Item shell hits, it may not have enough power to safely redirect it.
